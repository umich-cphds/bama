\description{
\code{bama} is a Bayesian inference method that uses continuous shrinkage priors
for high-dimensional Bayesian mediation analysis, developed by Song et al
(2018). \code{bama} provides estimates for the regression coefficients as
well as the posterior inclusion probability for ranking mediators.
}
\details{
\code{bama} uses two regression models for the two conditional relationships,
\eqn{Y | A, M, C} and \eqn{M | A, C}. For the outcome model, \code{bama}
uses
\deqn{Y = M \beta_M  + A * \beta_A + C* \beta_C + \epsilon_Y}
For the mediator model, \code{bama} uses the model
\deqn{M = A * \alpha_A + C * \alpha_C + \epsilon_M}

For high dimensional tractability, \code{bama} employs continuous Bayesian
shrinkage priors to select mediators and makes the two following assumptions:
First, it assumes that all the potential mediators contribute small effects
in mediating the exposure-outcome relationship. Second, it assumes
that only a small proportion of mediators exhibit large effects
("active" mediators). \code{bama} uses a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs
MCMC to generate posterior samples from the model.

\examples{
library(bama)

Y <- bama.data$y
A <- bama.data$a

# grab the mediators from the example data.frame
M <- as.matrix(bama.data[, paste0("m", 1:100)], nrow(bama.data))

# We just include the intercept term in this example as we have no covariates
# bama defaults C1 and C2 to be a matrix of 1s, so this is purely an
# illustration.
C <- matrix(1, 1000, 1)
beta.m  <- rep(0, 100)
alpha.a <- rep(0, 100)

set.seed(12345)
out <- bama(Y, A, M, C, C, beta.m, alpha.a, burnin = 1000, ndraws = 100)

# The package includes a function to summarise output from 'bama'
summary <- summary(out)
head(summary)
