Description: Building on the potential outcome framework for causal inference,
    we present a Bayesian mediation analysis method for an exposure, a
    continuous outcome and high-dimensional mediators. We rely on two Bayesian
    sparse linear mixed models to simultaneously analyze a relatively large
    number of mediators with potentially a small number being truly active. This
    sparsity assumption also allows us to extend univariate mediator analysis
    by casting the identification of active mediators as a variable selection
    problem and applying Bayesian methods with continuous shrinkage priors on
    the effects.
