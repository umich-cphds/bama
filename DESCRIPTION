Description: Perform mediation analysis in the presence of high-dimensional
    mediators based on the potential outcome framework. Bayesian Mediation
    Analysis (BAMA), developed by Song et al (2019) <doi:10.1111/biom.13189>,
    relies on two Bayesian sparse linear mixed models to simultaneously analyze
    a relatively large number of mediators for a continuous exposure and outcome
    assuming a small number of mediators are truly active. This sparsity
    assumption also allows the extension of univariate mediator analysis by
    casting the identification of active mediators as a variable selection
    problem and applying Bayesian methods with continuous shrinkage priors on
    the effects.
